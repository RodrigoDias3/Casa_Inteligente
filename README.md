Welcome to the Advanced Computer Architecture project of a Smart Home!

In this project, we explore the integration of cutting-edge technology to create a residential environment that is smart, efficient, and secure.

## Introduction

Our goal is to design a home that can automate everyday tasks, monitor the indoor and outdoor environment, ensure security, and offer convenience to its inhabitants. We use a variety of sensors and intelligent computing systems to achieve these objectives.

## Features

- **Advanced Security System**: We use motion sensors and a door lock with a code that can only be changed by knowing the previous code.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Light and temperature sensors automatically adjust lighting and heating, optimizing energy consumption.

## Functional Mockup

Check out the video below to see the Smart Home mockup in action:

## How to Use

Prerequisites:

1. Arduino IDE
2. A mockup with desired sensors and devices

Getting started:

1. Extract the files;
2. Open the files in the Arduino IDE;
3. Review the code and adjust it to the sensors and assembly previously made;
4. See the magic happen.
